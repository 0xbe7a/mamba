Welcome to mamba's documentation!
=================================

Mamba is a fast, robust, and cross-platform package manager that runs on Windows, OS X and Linux (ARM64 and PPC64LE included).
Mamba is fully compatible with `conda` packages and supports most of conda's commands. In fact, mamba was conceived as a _drop-in_ replacement for conda, offering higher speed and more reliable environment solutions.

We recommend to [start from `mambaforge`](getting_started) or install mamba through `conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge`, if you're already a conda user.

Mamba also offers a flavor specifically for the CI use-case ([micromamba](micromamba)). Micromamba is a single-file executable that comes with everything to start installing packages.
